<h1>Todo-List</h1>

<h2>Todo-List is a program that allows user to list things that have to be done. After typing description and date user is able to add them into a list underneath. User is also able to delete any object from the list clicking the icon.
</h2>

I learned about conditional rendering as the delete button is only displayed if there is a todo task. Also working with imports taught how to make code more simple as I could make code more reusable. 
Next time I will make css better so that its more enjoyable to use

This program was made as a school project part of a React.js course.
